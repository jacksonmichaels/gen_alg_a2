## Describe each of the four GIFs 
my 4 gifs are:
- a colorful brain with ripples and random changing dots
- a dark cloudy night with (kinda) random lighting
- infinite nested triangles spinning around screen
- transforming and growing fractal tree

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

i loved using p.sound, its a great way to get randomness that can return to a point

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?
 
some primatives but nothing important

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?
 
not really. I just made sure to always use the percent done and the percent done * 2 PI. Then if I move around the noise plane and return back when done they always moved cleanly

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

I did copy a lerp method from stack overflow and looked at a fractal implementation online that I modified heavily

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later

general JS sources like w3 school.
